/**
 * Vertical panning inside the phone's right drawer.
 *
 * The drawer is a fixed panel whose inner app pane keeps its own scroller, and
 * the drag has to cross three claims on the gesture: the app's own rows (which
 * grab the pointer for dragging), the drawer root (which the plugin turns into a
 * scrolling box as a fallback) and the pane's scroller. Re-granting
 * `touch-action: pan-y` to everything is enough for Chrome, but a device that
 * still swallows the move leaves the pane nailed in place, and none of that can
 * be inspected from here.
 *
 * So instead of betting on one more CSS combination, this module watches the
 * gesture and only steps in when the browser did *not* move the scroller by
 * itself. That hand-off test is what keeps it from ever double-scrolling: each
 * move compares the position against the position the gesture last knew about.
 * A browser that moved it is already doing the job and this module does nothing;
 * a browser that left it untouched gets the delta applied by hand, with the move
 * cancelled so the page behind the drawer stays put.
 *
 * Two things stay out of its way on purpose. A gesture that starts inside a box
 * that scrolls sideways (the dockkit tab strip of open files) belongs to that
 * box, and a gesture whose own axis is sideways belongs to the browser: the
 * fallback cancels the touch to apply its delta by hand, which would also kill
 * the strip's horizontal scroll, so it must never claim either of them.
