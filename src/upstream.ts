/**
 * Live-upstream resolution for the mobile access paths.
 *
 * The DSH Desktop app binds its web server on a random loopback port on every
 * launch (`reservePort`), so the plugin's configured `upstreamOrigin`
 * (historically a fixed 127.0.0.1:3080) cannot be trusted to point at the
 * live web server — and 3080 is often occupied by a different, older instance.
 *
 * The authoritative live origin comes from the host `webServer` service the
 * plugin is injected with; `DSH_WEB_URL` (a shell variable the web profile
 * publishes for spawned shells) is the second candidate, and the configured
 * origin is the last-resort fallback. Each candidate is validated as an HTTP
 * loopback origin, so an invalid value can never hijack the remote channel.
 * @module dsh-mobile-tailscale/upstream
