/**
 * Soft-keyboard repair for the phone terminal.
 *
 * DSH's terminal is xterm.js, which reads a key from `keydown` and steps aside
 * when the event carries the legacy IME code 229 — the code iOS and Android soft
 * keyboards report for keys they take over themselves. Letters survive because
 * the IME commits them through composition/text input, but a space press
 * produces no composition at all, and a punctuation press is usually just a 229
 * keydown with nothing behind it, so both are dropped and the terminal never
 * sees them.
 *
 * The repair cannot be another keydown. Measured against the real page, a
 * synthetic keydown carrying the reconstructed code never reaches the terminal
 * process: xterm steps aside for the very code that has to be repaired, so the
 * generated event lands in the same dead end as the one it replaces. What does
 * reach the process is xterm's own text path — the character written into
 * `.xterm-helper-textarea` followed by the `input` event xterm listens for. That
 * is what this module dispatches, and only when every other path stayed silent.
 *
 * Four rules keep the repair from ever typing twice:
 *
 * - Only a keydown carrying the legacy IME code is repaired. A keydown with a
 *   real code is one xterm already forwards, so repairing it would type the
 *   character a second time; that is also why this never counts outbound traffic
 *   to decide whether the key got through — the app's own streaming would look
 *   like "delivered" and stall every repair.
 * - Only space and punctuation are repaired. Letters and digits arrive through
 *   the IME's own commit, and that commit can land late, so repairing them would
 *   add the duplicate that once made the first typed character repeat.
 * - The textarea is looked up again for every repair: xterm swaps the helper
 *   node out between inputs, and an injection into a detached node is lost.
 * - Alphanumerics are never repaired, and a pending repair is cancelled the
 *   moment the terminal shows any other sign of the key: text or composition
 *   events inside `.xterm`, or a real `keypress`.
