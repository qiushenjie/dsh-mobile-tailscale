/**
 * RFC 7692 `permessage-deflate` between the phone and this plugin's two
 * WebSocket proxies. The mux socket is where a phone's switch latency lives:
 * the frame that opens a session (`session/follow`) arrives as one atomic
 * `snapshot` item, measured at 118-297 KB on the wire (2026-09-29, dsh
 * 0.1.7-rc.2), while the same server's HTTP responses are gzipped — a
 * 157,869-byte page body arrived as 32,086 bytes. JSON that compressible means
 * the phone waits several times longer than it must before the chat view shows
 * anything.
 *
 * The upstream DSH mux stays plain. It declines the extension today (its 101
 * carries `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: ""`), so the proxies accept the client's
 * offer on the proxy's own behalf and never forward the offer upstream; see the
 * upgrade handlers in `gateway.ts` and `remote-proxy.ts`.
 *
 * `Z_SYNC_FLUSH` is read off `constants` rather than imported by name: Node's
 * ESM facade for `node:zlib` exports the functions and `constants` but *not*
 * the bare constants, so `import { Z_SYNC_FLUSH } from 'node:zlib'` is a
 * module-load `SyntaxError` in the built `lib/index.mjs` — and a test runner
 * that resolves the builtin through its own interop reports `undefined`
 * instead, which no unit test can see.
