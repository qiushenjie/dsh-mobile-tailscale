/**
 * Holding a session open while the app is still loading it.
 *
 * The app starts a session's first page inside `sessions.retain(id, {source})`:
 * that call records the reference and *then* awaits `manager.get(id).open()`. The
 * navigation the retain belongs to can be aborted a few milliseconds later, and
 * the app's own navigation code then releases the very reference it just took.
 * When that was the only one, the controller retires the scope and disposes the
 * session -- while the first page is still in flight -- and the view that was
 * rendering it sits on 「载入历史…」 with nothing left to wake it up.
 *
 * The phone therefore takes a reference of its own for exactly that window. It is
 * acquired as the session enters `loading`, and given back as soon as the app
 * holds the session again (or after the guard's bounded grace period), so the
 * app's release can no longer drop the count to zero mid-open. Nothing else is
 * touched: no socket, no reload, no re-navigation.
