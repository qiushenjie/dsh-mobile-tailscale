/**
 * Debug telemetry channel for the phone surface.
 *
 * Two questions can only be answered on the device, so both sides of the fixed:
 * what a real finger does to the open drawer (the client posts one trace per
 * drag, see `gesture-telemetry.ts`), and how long the host takes to answer a
 * history page while an agent turn is running (the proxy times it here). Both
 * land in one JSON-lines file inside the DSH home so a developer can read the
 * device's behaviour from the machine.
 *
 * This is a debugging aid, not a product feature: it is written to be removed
 * again, it records class names and timings only (never text, never keystrokes),
 * and it rotates its own file so a forgotten run cannot fill the disk.
